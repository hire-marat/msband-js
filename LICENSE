== THE GOOD IDEA 2 LICENSE ==

This software is convergent information, bounded by the constraints of the
systems it is designed to communicate with, more commonly known as protocols.

Any sufficiently motivated and creative actor will converge on homomorphic
software, and therefore the author of this particular software is irrelevant.

As such, liability for the use of this information, (whether by execution of
any subset of the software, by static analysis of any subset of the
software, or any other process whereby the information acts as an input to the
process, directly or indirectly) lies solely with the executor or analyser, and
not with the author of the software.

To conserve the sanctity of the author's blood/sweat/tears, this software is
released for use, under this permissive license, with the following restriction:

The contents of this license must re-distributed with any redistributed subset
of the software in such a way that a prominent and accessible method is provided
where that method graphically reproduces the exact Latin glyphs this license
consists of, in a legible and accessible fashion.

Any software derived from this originating information, is derived with the
understanding and acceptance that any changes made in the derivative software
may be incorporated into the originating information, becoming solely governed
by this LICENSE.

It is not recommended that this software be used for commercial purposes.
